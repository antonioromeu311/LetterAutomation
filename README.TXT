LETTER AUTOMATION 1.1 README FEB 2020
AUTHOR: ANTONIO ROMEU
I was asked to create this program by some of the staff at Viera High School, to automate the process of creating a letter for each
student that was selected for an award.
This program uses a GUI to automate the creation of the letters for the students who receive an award at the junior awards ceremony at Viera High School


TECHNICAL SIDE

The file for the data should be saved as : "UnderClassmenAwardData" and it shoudld be saved as a .csv file (comma seperated values)
To save a file in Excel as a csv file: file, save as, click on the drop box below file name, select .csv (comma seperated values)
The data should be saved in the same directory as this program (JuniorLetterMaker.jar)
The format for cells should be the following:
LastName   FirstName   DayofWeek   Date   Email   AdminFirstName   AdminLastName
None of the fields should have any spaces
Then simply click the create button and the pdf file will be saved in the same directory as the jar is hosted.


SIMPLER TERMS

The name of the excel file should be: "UnderClassmenAwardData" and should be a csv file (directions above)
The excel file should be in the same folder as the java program (JuniorLetterMaker)
These are the names that the columns should have(in this order and spelling, no spaces)
LastName   FirstName   DayofWeek   Date   Email   AdminFirstName   AdminLastName
There are no spaces allowed in any of the excel file because it will mess up how the program reads the data
Once all this is done, click the create button and the single pdf file will be saved in the same folder


WHAT I LEARNED

In this project, I drastically improved my skills on reading and storing data from csv files, as well as using data split and arrays.
Along with this, I learned how to import third party libraries and incorporate them into my code successfully. 
With the iText library, I learned how to write to a PDF file and save it into a specific directory.
I also further improved my skills to make a user friendly GUI, and make a trouble shooting button and more user to program communication.
Overall, I furthered my ability to proficiently use Java as a tool to complete client requests.
